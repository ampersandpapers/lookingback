				<h4 style="margin:0;font-size:22px;color:#111;">Ye Olde Autumn Grove</h4>

				It is, perhaps, possible that this group wakes up in the literal inspiration for <i>In The Bleak Midwinter</i>, for as they come to in the clearing of the wood, the trees are bare and the ground white. It is also very obvious from the moment you awake that, due to looking as if you’ve raided the local Medieval Times for fits, you are <i>most definitely in the 800s.</i> You know: around the time that most of you, more or less, were last alive. Fun times!<br><br>

Since the majority of the reincarnated folk are pretty aware that it’s either make your way to a city center or starve, you track your way to the local road pretty quick. (Small blessings: you are, at least, very warm in your cloaks and woolens.) It’s soon apparent that you’re not the only folks on the trail, as so is the rest of the surrounding folks that are within traveling distance. As it so happens, you’ve stumbled upon the fiefdom of Lord Altwidus of Weck, whose temper is apparently fickle and self-involved enough that he’s deemed his birthday worthy of a week-long festival just prior to Advent-tide. <i>Bold.</i><br><br>

Altwidus has a few options for how his serfs celebrate his birthday, and as y’all have come without any money or gifts, it is apparent what you must do once you cross the gates into Weck proper: allow yourselves, as a group, to be submitted to the Great Tournament that is central to the festivities. And yes, if you were expecting feats of fighting errant monsters in the ring interspersed with moments of brief and brilliant horsemanship? <i>You would be correct.</i><br><br>

For being fresh out of high school circa 2021 AD, you do… okay. At the least, y’all do well enough to be invited to the feast after, which is basically clearing the bottom line of success. (Although, one of you <i>does</i> get an admirer for your efforts.) It’s a good thing too, for some of you with past lives are able to cling upon the coattails of your previous selves as they sprinkle along some meat and potatoes that you’ll eventually want to pass along to the school once you realize your phones still work. <br><br>

Specifically? You’re able to eavesdrop and hear at the feast that Lord Altwidus inherited a great mirror specifically heard to be frequented as a portal for Children of Yggdrasil. You know, those strange little people that know how to speak to the Old Tree of Germanic lore. Rumor has it that they are able to see many possibilities within Yggdrasil’s branches and the mirrors are how they slip between each one. Hmm, <i>sound familiar?</i> Especially to you, Ms. V. Rivers? <i>Hmmmm????</i><br><br>

Once you hear about the mirrors &ndash; and let yourself have a little bit of mead, it’s perfectly understandable after the hard and cold day you’ve had &ndash; it’s time to sneak to find that mirror. (And also, maybe tell the school that looking for a mirror is the way to go.) So after you go around the feast hall to ask the important things, you find out that it’s in the castle’s library. And although you find it well, you do <i>not</i> find it with a lot of finesse &ndash; like hey, maybe keep it down with all the giggling? Those guards don’t seem particularly pleased about what you’re doing, but also who cares? You’re through the mirror and &ndash; hopefully &ndash; on your way home!
