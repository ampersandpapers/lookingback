<i>You shouldn’t go out there, Fawn. What if they’re looking for you?</i><br><br>

Her mother’s words were wise. She knew that she was right, much as she hated to admit it, but that didn’t mean that she could follow her advice. She was sitting on information that she couldn’t share&mdash; not with anyone, but when she saw things like Lewis Kitton’s tiktok with the monster in the background, she knew she somehow <i>had</i> to tell people what she’d seen, and she was so preoccupied with how she was going to accomplish that, that she felt restless and distracted all the time. If she didn’t run in the woods, how would she continue functioning like a semi-reasonable human being? How would she <i>think</i>?<br><br>

She certainly couldn’t go out there as herself, not with whatever that <i>thing</i> was lurking in there somewhere. She couldn’t defend herself in her weak, fragile human form, and running in the woods surrounding their little farmstead hadn’t been an issue for her yet. <br><br>

She was beginning to think that everyone had mostly forgotten about the large predator who had dropped their friend’s body off on school grounds. Thankfully. So just like she had in her spare time for weeks, Fawn shifted and she loped off into the woods&mdash; to think. To forget. To just pretend that everything was alright. <br><br>
