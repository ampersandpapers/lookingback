				<h4 style="margin:0;font-size:22px;color:#111;">The Ghost of Autumn Groves Future</h4>

				One minute, the members of this group are in their respective home rooms, and the next? The blistering heat and humidity of a Massachusetts summer are on their asses as they tumble out of <i>the mirrored back of a bar</i>. More specifically, it’s the bar back of The Elms and it’s happy hour… and y’all are underage. <br><br>

For a very busy bar at 4pm on a Monday, all of the denizens seem pretty unphased that a bunch of teens fell through it. It might be the general air of drunk depression in the air, or maybe it’s all of the cross-talk about the unsettling supernatural nonsense that seems to have been coming out of nowhere to their little town of Autumn Grove. Someone in your group at least has the wherewithal to sit down and eavesdrop for a few minutes so that they’re able to deduce that, uh… these folks are <i>just</i> learning about magic. In fact, a lot of what they’re mentioning sounds an awful lot like the events of 2020 for Autumn Grove all over again.<br><br>

A weary-eyed lady that looks familiar to one of you but you can’t <i>quite</i> put your finger on as to why lets you know that there’s going to be a Town Hall meeting about this, as well as recommending that they go to the Autumn Grove Public Library to ask for some help from Kyle. Grumpy as she may be, she might be able to help with your lack-of-housing situation, and she seems pretty adamant that you’re not going to deal with the entire… uh, being outside alone in the dark thing. <br><br>

On the way over to the Town Hall, <b>Tiff Owens</b> discovers that everyone can still message via their <i>original</i> school network, and she alerts the entire school &ndash; who are apparently spread across four universes that are not their own? &ndash; that they can all communicate together appropriately. So if you wanna holla at your bestie? No text, only DMs.<br><br>

This is the last bit of good news you get for the past hour as you stumble into the Town Hall and find that it’s helmed at the front by some guy in a moth-eaten fisherman’s sweater named Josh. He seems tired and cranky and promptly tells all y’all the blessed truth: the Headless Horseman is on the loose. And he’s not just the regular Headless Horseman but is apparently also an undead cannibal that rides every night of the full moon. You know, for funsies.<br><br>

And tonight? It’s the full moon.<br><br>

But beyond that, as your group sits there, you start to recognize some faces in the crowd. More specifically, they all… look like you. And none of you look like you’re in good shape in the <i>slightest.</i> If you try to talk to your older selves to find out their deal? That’s all on you, honestly, but you might also just wanna… go back to the library and crash. Especially once you start to hear about glowing mirrors on the network.<br><br>

				<h4 style="margin:0;font-size:22px;color:#111;">College... In Space!</h4>

				Apparently, Space just has nothing but gross things for you to step into, because as you’re shimmying out from the dark, angsty potential of your future, you’ve managed to sidle all the way up into… barf. More specifically, frat kegger barf. <i>Sexy.</i><br><br>

But it’s possible that things might be getting okay? As your crew wiggles into the party, you find out that this isn’t just any frat party: this is a frat party for the lone space fae collective on campus, Kappa Kappa Psi. The space fae, which is the Common word for them, are gorgeous beings that have rather a lot in common with their terrestrial brethren… although as to <i>what</i> court they may be a member of is not entirely clear to the group. At any rate, they’re very eager for you to try… uh, someone’s wine! They say it’s theirs. Either way, the majority of you partake and it’s… well, it sure is an <i>Experience.</i><br><br>

This party’s general luck roll is at a <b>three</b>, so you can bet your bottom that the wine you consume has more than a few bad effects aside from the magical ones. But at least you have a bit of fun some of the time.

				<h4 style="margin:0;font-size:22px;color:#111;">Ye Olde Autumn Grove</h4>

				Oh, sweet darlings &ndash; it rather looks like you’ve hopped out of the frying pan and into the fire. True, you didn’t hop out of a baptismal font like your predecessors, but showing up in the middle of the town fountain and the town of Weck is <i>fucking over it.</i> So much for being able to fight for your right to party: you are, apparently, going straight into the dungeon. <i>What a drag.</i><br><br>

At the least, your party takes the time to perk your pretty ears as you’re being led down into… one entire cell? What? Weird. Turns out that Lord Altwidus has a trigger-happy finger for chaining people up, so your particular status is less of a statement about your supposed mischief and far more about the mental state of Ye Olde Lord. At any rate, you’re not split up… and you know what they say about strength in numbers, right?
