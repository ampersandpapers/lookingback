			<i>God bless Matthew fuckin’ Francisco</i>, Brock Fitzpatrick thought to himself as he made a sharp knock on the deliveries door at the back of the rink, a ratty old AGHS stick bag from the goddamn seventies balanced on one hip while Brock’s actual bag dangled in counterbalance off the opposite shoulder. Almost immediately, good ol’ Zamboni Matt swung open the door with a friendly grin, which Brock mirrored back with ease.<br><br>

“Whoa, they still have that damn thing?” Matt asked after the old bag as Brock walked inside, shuffling his cargo down to the floor almost immediately as the incumbent AGHS captain rocked back on his heels. <br><br>

“Yeah, go fuckin’ figure, right?” Brock looked over his shoulder, his grin still wide, pointing at the decrepit piece of kit. “Traditions are traditions, though. I thought Minzy was gonna shit himself when he handed it over to me after the banquet last year, man, those straps were about done for.”<br><br>

The bag in question, of course, was the Captain’s Heirloom: a series of… well, tchotchkes, really. But as Brock unzipped the bag, the reverence he had betrayed that these weren’t merely <i>objects</i> but rather something far more auspicious. So when Brock reached into one of the last remaining bags of kit from the first State tournament winners in Autumn Grove history, past the occasional old puck of a shut-out goalie or the lucky sweatband of another, it wasn’t for just some regular old piece of battered shit. It was another link in a chain that stretched back, to brothers and fathers and uncles before them, to their battles on the ice.<br><br>

Even if that piece of battered shit was an Ouija board.<br><br>

Matt chuckled despite himself at the sight. “Didn’t expect to see the old board still kicking, either.”<br><br>

“Yeah,” Brock said, the agreement mildly laced with pride before he rocked back on his heels to press to standing. He sighed as he rubbed at his face, feeling grimy under the bright orange overalls he was still wearing, the weathered <i>Grundens</i> hoodie that sat underneath it a little crunchier from salt than he’d like, “Mind if I leave this shit back here while I hit the locker room?” Matt, to his credit, merely replied with a broad shake of his dreads and a wide smile and Brock gave him a thumbs up as he ambled off.<br><br>

Brock stifled a short-tempered <i>fuck</i> as he crammed his bibs into the lockers, his tech pants peeling off into a gross pile of salt and sweat in his bag as he traded for his team warm up pants. His mood was always sour straight off the boat but the ice would help, a bracing thing to remember as he laced his skates and made his way to the ice with the game in hand. He checked his pockets for everything else before he pushed off for a quick spin around the rink.<br><br>

Normally, he’d line up center ice but he needed a moment to square into his head and he let that happen with a lap or three, the sharp chill of the AC drying the sweat off his head and blowing whatever detritus always managed to build up in the little crevices of his chest whenever he’d been pulling up basket after basket of lobsters hollering for a respite. By the time he finally made his way to the great circle in the center of the rink, Brock felt a little more like himself &ndash; and the sight that greeted him as he went to squat down to plop the Ouija board right on the blue dot certainly helped.<br><br>

“Hey,” he offered towards his A as he surveyed the work done thus far. “Looks sick, man.”<br><br>

“Thanks, dude.”  Said A offered up his hand, clad in a cheap stretch knit glove, for a fistbump, which Brock returned with the automatic ease of a thousand prior greetings and locker room rituals.<br><br>

“I borrowed the marker from one of the figure skating coaches,” he explained.  Reciting that kind of mundane detail left Sebastian feeling oddly unsettled, and it only took him a moment to realize it was because he normally <i>wouldn’t</i>.  Sebastian Salinas didn’t make small talk or offer up information to most people, and for months, with Brock, he hadn’t needed to.  After the spring and summer, he was used to letting his best friend slip into his mind.  Brock could have felt the sense memory of having inscribed a pentagram into the center circle and drawn over the paths with marker as though it were his own skate that had carved those lines, except that the path was closed.<br><br>

Maybe that had something to do with whatever Brock was keeping from him, Sebastian figured, but he pushed aside all of his curiosity and his unease at whatever mysterious circumstance had come between them of late.  Initiation night was about the team, and if Sebastian couldn’t get over his personal bullshit, then he didn’t deserve to wear the A.  He cleared his throat.  “You got a lighter?”<br><br>

“Yeah man,” Brock replied easy, slipping into a squat as he offered the lighter in question, his lip worrying a bit as he tossed it Sally’s way. Brock was feeling something off in kind, but unlike his buddy’s exactitude in pinpointing the absence, Brock only knew something was strange in his gut. He’d suss it later, though; the boys were his priority, a reverential thing to keep in mind as he set the Ouija board up, the funny little planchette cracked around its lens as Brock dropped it from his palm.<br><br>

Balanced Slav squat on the ice as he was, Brock’s hunt in his pockets for his particular things to bring to The Great Timmys Altar was something of a scramble. The two pucks that went to State clattered to the left and a mysterious looking… well, it might’ve been some sort of Flat Stanley at one point, but nevertheless it fluttered down to Brock’s right with sad, musty grace. It was very clear the moment that Brock leaned it against the tin of coffee beans that it was a rather ancient cut-out of the great coffee d-man in question, Tim Horton’s features barely recognizable from the years of folding and present water splotch that made his right leg a bit soggy.<br><br>

“Shit, think I left something in the bag, man,” Brock muttered, a grumble and a sigh managing to tumble out of him at the same time as he pushed back up to standing. He gave Sally’s back a pat as he asked, “Need anything?” before he started going towards the boards, still not quite parsing that Sebastian’s response would not be something that’d follow in the back of his head.<br><br>

Not that he would’ve remembered it anyway, as he stopped with a little bit more snow than he usually liked before he made it to the benches. He took a peek at the rink clock before looking back over towards the boards again, a genuinely sheepish expression spreading over his face as he took his time in skating the rest of the way.<br><br>

“Yo, Tingle, we tell you the wrong time buddy?” Brock’s voice carried a very real concern in it; he hadn’t exactly been on his A game this week, after all, and he rubbed the back of his neck with a certain amount of bashful embarrassment. “Fuckin’ sorry if we did, man, but we’re almost done setting up. Promise.” <br><br>

“No worries, bro,” Jimmy reassured him. He hustled across the ice to catch a stray rolling Duracell that had escaped one of the electric votive candles, then folded at the waist to reinsert it. Backing up, he nodded encouragingly as he surveyed Sebastian’s handiwork. <br><br>

“Nice,” he appraised, as he glided backwards around the circle with the star-shaped thingy inside. “Anarchy shit. Rage against the machine, man.”<br><br>

“Great band,” Sebastian said absently, barely registering Jimmy’s presence as he reached with the blade of his hockey stick to poke another one of the electric candles into place.<br><br>

It was only after he had tucked his stick under his arm and was fiddling with Brock’s lighter and the sole <I>real</I> candle in the setup that he realized that the reference was complete out of place, and Ting had misinterpreted the setup.  The lighter sparked, but he didn’t hold it down long enough to light a flame.  “Wait, what?  No.”<br><br>

“Nah, bud,” Brock corrected as he returned, the final piece of the puzzle complete in the palm of his hand as he came up behind Jimmy, his free hand ready to clap the rook on the back. “This here is the primary condor towards hockey greatness, a link between yourself and every brother that has worn the sweater for Autumn Grove.”<br><br>

He glided forward then to place a small statuette on top of the Timmy’s tin, a faded plastic thing clearly from the 70s, making sure to flick the helmeted head down as he did. In response, the generic d-man bobble head began to nod, its missing teeth grinning back up at the boys in dead-eyed glee. Pleased, Brock glided back to survey the set-up, smile broad as he placed his hands on his hips.<br><br>

“Nah, brother: we’re gonna have a talk beyond the vap— uhh, the vein— we’re gonna talk to Timmy Horton’s ghost about the season, bud.”<br><br>

Jimmy, who’d been executing neat bracket turns on the circle’s perimeter, suddenly windmilled his arms and treaded his skates to keep from falling backwards. “Yo!” he exclaimed, once he’d regained bodily composure. “We’re gonna summon the donut man himself?! You for real, boys?”<br><br>

Brock, a simple man who says what he means and means what he says, simply regarded Jimmy at that moment with a gaze of dull confusion. “I mean, yeah man. It’s literally just what I said.”<br><br>

WIth an awed look on his face, Jimmy backed away from the circle, giving it several more inches’ reverence. He regarded the Ouija board in silence for a moment, and then skepticism darkened his brow. “I dunno, boys. One time, my skating partner and me asked the Oo-ja board if we were gonna break 100 that year at Nationals, but it turned out to be wrong.” <br><br>

“Maybe you were doing it wrong.”  Sebastian, who had finally lit and placed the one real candle in the center of the circle by the Ouija board, stood up, brushing the snow off of his knees.  He flipped his hockey stick over his shoulder, not unlike a hobo’s bindle, or an adventurer’s sword.  The artificially-flickering light from the electric candles reflected dimly in his pale eyes, almost like they too were glowing ice.  “Don’t question the initiation, Tingle,” he said, not aggressively, but not without menace either.<br><br>

At this, Jimmy, who’d been about to protest the lit candle for the sake of Ice Safety—he <i>was</i> a paid rink employee, after all—closed his mouth and said nothing.  Anyway, Sebastian was a rink employee too, and if anything went wrong with the ice, it would be <i>his</i> job to patch it up.<br><br>

<i>Thank God Sal’s the A,</i> Brock thought with a sigh as he skated backwards, unwittingly only telegraphing his gratitude to Sebastian by way of a weary smile. He liked Ting, but the guy was not used to being bottom rung for shit. Putting up on the board would help with that a little, but so too would threading him through the year of customs that made the Leafs the <i>Leafs.</i> And in Ting’s case, that meant busting his balls along with the rest of the rooks that just came up from JV and calling up to Timmy for some advice. <br><br>

Or rather: it’d mean busting Ting’s balls with the rest of the rooks if the other rooks would <i>show up.</i><br><br>

Brock craned his head up at the barn clock: <i>12:00</i> on the dot, just like he said, and not another goddamn rook in the rink. He furrowed his brow and scowled a rare scowl, taking a lap to see if anybody was inexplicably… lost? For fuck’s sake, not like they didn’t practice here every goddamn <i>day</i> or anything&mdash;<br><br>

“Sally,” he barked out, fists knotting in his pants. “We said fuckin’ midnight, right?” At this rate, the rest of the boys would be coming in to fuck with Tingle and it’d just be him. And that… that wasn’t right. In more ways than one.<br><br>

“Sure did, bud,” Sebastian confirmed.  “Watched Laney set, like, four alarms.”  He knew better than to expect punctuality from most of the team, but the initiation ceremony was an easy chance for the new players to prove to the upperclassman that they were all-in on the team.  Their driven, fastidious 2C certainly wasn’t one to let an opportunity like that slip through his gloves.<br><br>

Usually, Brock did too. But Brock wasn’t usually fresh off a twelver and scolded himself for being such a pent-up dildo in his head. <I>Give ‘em fifteen,</i> he thought with a pinch to his brow. Even though, apparently, he’d told Tingle early. Even though, yes, Laney was screwed tighter than a bunch of Mentos in a pop bottle and would’ve goddamn set up the altar himself if you’d let him. <br><br>

“Sorry, I’ll calm my fuckin’ tits,” he offered, but even as he did, Brock felt a chill down his spine that he couldn’t quite clock. It wasn’t a <I>cold</i> shiver; he’d be a shit hockey player if the barn temp got to him that quick. But something felt off to Brock in a wordless sort of way, beyond the miasma of working a job he hated or trying to get his goddamn poop in a group about Sally. It even felt stranger than the night with the chalupacabra chick and all the frayed worry he’d held in himself, thin and keening, about to break his heart open until the very second he’d finally resolved it.<br><br>

No, this was a different sort of shiver that traveled down Brock Fitzpatrick’s spine: icy, uneasy, lead in the gut and down his veins. It felt silly to be scared, and he sure as hell hoped it didn’t shine in his eyes as he stopped his nervous pacing to stand above the candles at center rink. Maybe, he’d check in—<br><br>

<I>Wait. Huh.</i><br><br>

It was a bad time to ask, given the company, but even if Brock had been rude enough, there wasn’t time for it as a sudden gust of wind shuttered through the rink with a great enough blast to blow out the lone live flame.<br><br>

You know. In a goddamn skating rink.<br><br>

Brock’s response to this was appropriately to the point: “The fuck?”<br><br>

“H-holy shit,” Jimmy concurred, halfway between a nervous laugh and a stutter. Ice rinks were cold by design—no shit—but the sudden chill he felt went beyond just the ambient temperature, which felt like it had just plummeted to the single digits. Now his jaw was chattering, and his breath was coming in clouds thick enough that he had to wave to disperse them. <br><br>

Come to think of it, it was getting awfully foggy in here.<br><br>

“D-did you guys,” Jimmy began, looking apprehensively between the uncharacteristically irritable Cap, and his characteristically surly A, “like, do <i>real magic?</i>” These last two words whispered, as though he weren’t sure he had earned the privilege to use such language.<br><br>

“We haven’t even started,” Sebastian snapped, still surly.  “You know I just do shit with plants.”  The local ice rink was not exactly teeming with them. Brock, meanwhile, merely offered a short shake of his head, lips pressed into a flat line. He’d explain what the fuck he did later &ndash; now was <i>not</i> the time.<br><br>

Sebastian’s breath puffed in front of him in the cold, but most of the fog seemed to be rolling in from elsewhere.  By his reckoning, one of two things was most likely to have happened.  Either they were being punked, or they were experiencing another one of Autumn Grove’s signature spooky events.  They could even be getting pranked <i>by</i> the supernatural.<br><br>

He looked to the bleachers, though they were barely visible, between the darkened rink, the fogged plexiglass around the ice, and the thin layer of mist hovering above the benches.  There was no way to know if someone was hiding there, but there was no harm in guessing there was.  “Hey!” Sebastian hollered.  “You got us.  Real funny ha ha.  You can cut the shit and come out now.”<br><br>

Sebastian didn’t get much by way of response &ndash; verbally, anyway. But the fog did begin cloak in the stands as the doors began to rattle, the distinct sound of boys hollering in the background well apparent to Brock’s (possibly paranoid?) ear. But as a dim, hollow wind seemed to roar outside and the doors continued to rattle, Brock was starting to think that it might just be weird weather. Hey! Weird weather in fuckin’ coastal Mass, right? Who’da thought?<br><br>

Brock was rotating slow to turn back to the seance display, ready to see if he needed to fiddle with anything else before checking the doors when, with very little fanfare, the bobblehead started to wobble.<br><br>

From the bobblehead, clear as day, rounded Canadian vowels and all: <small>OH. HEY THERE, BOYS.</small><br><br>

To say that Brock Gallagher Fitzpatrick screamed bloody murder then as he jumped back from the circle was, to put it mildly, an understatement.<br><br>

“<i>Who said that?</i>  hissed Jimmy, arms cradled protectively over his now-drenched Supreme sweatshirt. Even his moisture-wicking performance joggers were damp, and he wondered if he’d pissed himself with fear. The fog was so thick around him that he couldn’t see past the boards into the stands, where some joker with a hokey accent was—he hoped—masterminding this trick.<br><br>

He raised his voice, trying to sound authoritative. “And you can shut off the fog machine now!”<br><br>

While Sebastian was not the most well-versed in magical lore of anyone in Autumn Grove, he <I>was</I> fairly good at triangulating sounds, he was used to taking the strategic point position, and somehow had more visibility than Ting.  The center dot was his turf, in games.  So when he heard the voice, he slid down to his knees, stick grounded in the ice like a staff, and faced down the bobblehead at its source.  “Are you doing this?” he demanded.<br><br>

<small>OH, NO.  SORRY, BUD!</small> the bobblehead said, sounding intensely Canadian.  <small>HONESTLY, I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU BUSTED IT OUT FOR ME.  NOT THAT YOU HAD TO, OF COURSE.  I DON'T NEED ANYTHING SPECIAL.</small><br><br>

Brock, a Masshole to his bones but one with manners nevertheless, parroted back almost instantly, “Nah, guests always need somethin’ niceoooooh <I>whoa!!</i> Wait! Wait a fuckin’ <I>minute!</i>”<br><br>

It was undeniable, as the Captain scrambled down to the ice, that the moment he put the pieces together he lit up like it was Christmas morning. Honestly, this might be even better. Christmas never came with legendary hockey advice. “Holy shit. Is it, wait fuck, oh, sorry sir— <I>sir, are you actually Tim Horton?</i>”<br><br>

<small>OH, YAH,</small> the bobblehead confirmed, and Brock <I>swore</i> that his little head shook a little more. <small>THOUGHT YOU KNEW THAT, BUD, BUT THAT’S ALRIGHT. WOULD YOU MIND TAKING DOWN THE COMPETITION DURING MY VISIT, THOUGH? BAD FOR BUSINESS, EH?</small><br><br>

Before Brock could even so much as budge, a lone Dunkin’s cup fell from the boards to roll onto the ice as the doors busted in and the boys – rather noisily – started to filter in. Whatever. He turned back to the bobblehead, grinning so hard his cheeks hurt from the effort.<br><br>

“You got it, old man. Mind if we ask you for some advice?”

			Welcome, AGHS Varsity Hockey, to the annual Rooks Initiation Night. For any of the vets on the team, you know that this is always in the form of a very hokey seance, with a typical C-and-A prank sprinkled in to make you feel like you’re a baby back bitch. So far, it’s shaping up as if the C-and-A prank is… being locked out of the rink proper? What the actual fuck? Most likely, if you’re a member that showed up to either be present for or help with the initiation, you found this out by way of seeing second-line center Bridger Lane at the door wildly panicking because he was “going to be late” and he’d “never live it down.” Ah, Laney. Maybe take it down a few notches, bud?<br><br>

But eventually, the doors <i>do</i> fly open, and a shitload of fog rolls out. There, on center ice, is your C and A, who are apparently talking to… a bobble head? Transfer rookie Jimmy Ting is there too, looking fresh in his Supreme hoodie even if it’s a little wet (?), but whatever. Turns out, Leadership accidentally started the seance without you guys, because Tim Horton is <i>actually fucking here.</i> Hooray!<br><br>

Thing is, when Sebastian and Brock brought Tim Horton through the veil to ask some hockey questions, the bros accidentally brought some hitchhikers through as well. So while the boys ask some queries sotto voce within the confines of the ice, some other ghosties will be sliding into Autumn Grove proper to have a good night &ndash; and day &ndash; on the town. <b>These ghosts will be out and about for a week, so please feel free to mention any run-ins at all with some super-duper weirdos. It’s up to you to have some creative fun, so if you want a possession? A weird reflection that talks back to you at night? Simply a bit of a spoop? Go for it! Just know that they’ll be gone on <span style="color:#2F8B01;">Friday, October 15th…</span> more or less.</b>

			THE GHOSTS

			<div style="margin-bottom:10px;padding-bottom:15px;border-bottom:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">

			<b style="font-size:14px;color:#2F8B01;">TIM HORTON</b></br>
A gentleman, a scholar, a legendary d-man, a donut magnate: Tim Horton, a former star of the Toronto Maple Leafs (1949-1974) now most famous for his iconic Canadian donut-and-coffee chain, is a surprisingly mild-mannered chap for, you know, being a big-ass dude who used to slam people into the boards for a living. Present only for the night of the seance itself, Tim Horton and his sage advice, delivered in a devastatingly Canadian accent, is dispensed via a generic bobblehead that kinda looks like him if you squint real hard.<br><br>

<b style="font-size:14px;color:#2F8B01;">EUSTACHIUS OF CRETE</b></br>
For whatever reason, one of the ghosts that slipped through the cracks? Some Greek sailor who wears little, says even less, and feels a little… sleazy? Built AF, though, which hardly makes up for the fact that whenever he “speaks,” it’s mostly the gravelly gurgles of a drowning man.<br><br>

<b style="font-size:14px;color:#2F8B01;">LORRAINE BOBBIT</b></br>
There’s always been a rumor that the Autumn Grove High School Varsity Hockey Team has been pretty killer… sometimes <i>literally.</i> This particular rumor? That in 1949, Lorraine Bobbit was in the front row of a particular heated battle between the Leafs and their rivals, the Gloucester Shuckers, when an errant puck from a Shucker hit her right in the <i>exact</i> place on her nose where it’d give her brain damage and she <i>died</i>. Turns out, the rumor is <i>true</i>, and Lorraine has been waiting 72 years to be released on the other side of the shroud to creep on half-naked boys with shelf butts in the locker room. Her face is pretty gnarly given her cause of death, and any jock within a 50-mile radius of Autumn Grove should be <i>very</i> concerned for their privacy.<br><br>

<b style="font-size:14px;color:#2F8B01;">JOHN ELIOT</b></br>
A Puritan’s Puritan, John Eliot was the appointed Missionary to Massachusetts Bay Colony to the native population. As such, he’s a huge dick. Expect him to run up to any and all of you and scream about y’all being witches. Which, uh, no shit John. Glad you got on Autumn Grove’s level, you weirdo.<br><br>

<b style="font-size:14px;color:#2F8B01;">HARRIET WITHERFIELD</b></br>
The wife of a whaler who sailed upon the high seas in the 1850s, Harriet far preferred her life when her husband was on the seas and she could have her “bosom companion” stay during the cold nights. A sweet and quiet ghost, you can tell how she died by the crick of her neck from her jump off the widow’s walk when she saw her husband’s boat come back that one last time.<br><br>

<b style="font-size:14px;color:#2F8B01;">RYAN MCALLEN</b></br>
Poor Ryan, he was just a kid playing shinny on one of the cranberry ponds in the 20s when he misjudged the thickness of the water and ended up busting through the ice. For a guy who fell through the ice, he’s a pretty cheerful and friendly ghost &ndash; after all, he <i>did</i> die doing what he loved the most, and isn’t that nice?<br><br>

<b style="font-size:14px;color:#2F8B01;">KIMBERLEY CHOI</b></br>
The 1980s were wild, right? Kimberley agrees, as her fashion is on point and her eternal crimp to <i>die</i> for. Except, well, she didn’t actually wanna die for it, but sometimes it’s the last day of school and you think that the janitor confiscated your crimper and um, did someone lock you in here? Did someone <i>seriously</i> lock you in here? What the <i>frick???</i> Now, decades later, Kimberley is here to walk into your slumber party and, like, ask you all the fun gossip? Hel<i>lo</i>, all the oldies on the other side are way boring, Tai.<br><br>

<b style="font-size:14px;color:#2F8B01;">PAUL REVERE</b></br>
No. Literally. It’s what it says on the tin. Will run through the town every night at 10pm screaming that the British are coming until further notice.<br><br>

<b style="font-size:14px;color:#2F8B01;">ROBERT ARNOLD</b></br>
He is the British that is coming. Not, like, sexually. He’s a Redcoat, you fuckin’ weirdo.<br><br>

<b style="font-size:14px;color:#2F8B01;">ERIC LAIRD</b></br>
A kid just like you and me, except for the part where he was already a card-toting teamster who died in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Molasses_Flood">Great Molasses Flood of 1919</a>. Alternates between screaming and looking like a slime monster. Whenever he’s in your area, sticky brown ooze starts dripping from the walls, but it’s pretty tasty if you’re into molten brown sugar.<br><br>

<b style="font-size:14px;color:#2F8B01;">DAVY JONES</b></br>
You thought it was the pirate? Please. We’re talking 1960s heart-throb <i>Davy Jones</i>, straight out of the Monkees and into your heart! Thing is, this motherfucker kinda smells… weird. Like, “fermented tube socks” weird. If this ghostie flits in and out of your periphery, expect whimsical mid-60s one-hit wonders to come out of your radio and for everyone to start sniffing their armpits whenever you’re around. Supes funky, brah.<br><br>
