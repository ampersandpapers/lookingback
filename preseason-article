			Preseason Hockey Comes Up Short
		</div>
		
		<small>ELLIOT HAIGH</small><br><br>

		Preseason, historically speaking, has always been up for grabs for the Autumn Grove Leafs Hockey, with the start to the 2021-2022 season erring on the side of some of their more uneven seasons with a double-header loss on Tuesday to West Boyslon and Wednesday to school rival Gloucester. With the loss of what would have been senior Garrett Underwood to the USA Hockey National Team Development Program in the spring, the Leafs’ offensive lines are looking choppy and are failing to connect on the ice consistently throughout either game. <br><br>

The Leafs’ first preseason matchup against the WBHS Warriors on Tuesday at the Nichewaug Classic was close, chippy, and high-scoring, with near identical possession times and shots on goal, but a few careless mistakes and an apparent lack of coordination and focus eventually cost AGHS the game. The Leafs ended the first period down 0-2, with plenty of time spent in the offensive zone but an apparent lack of finish. They began their comeback when senior Landon Geuze managed to convert a powerplay early in the second, assisted by junior Charles McNamara. Senior Brock Fitzpatrick, assisted by junior Jimmy Ting and senior John Jones, scored on a second powerplay to tie the game at 2-2. The Leafs drew another penalty shortly thereafter, but goaltender senior Willie Justice lost the puck in the crease, and it went over the line into the net for an own goal. The Warriors took advantage of the Leafs’ confusion to score again, bringing the game to 2-4 at the end of the second period.<br><br>

Coach Lukas Novak pulled Justice before the third period, giving sophomore Anson Sweeney his first chance between the pipes. Penalties continued to fly on both sides, and though AGHS failed to convert another powerplay, they netted a short-handed goal from senior Sebastian Salinas, assisted by sophomore Stevie McMichael and junior Robert Dugnutt, the three skaters remaining on the ice after Fitzpatrick and Geuze were simultaneously assessed minor penalties and sent to the box. The Warriors scored again to regain their 2-goal lead, but the Leafs crawled back up in the points standings with an even-strength goal from Ting, assisted by junior Michael Truch and sophomore Bridger Lane. The Leafs couldn’t find the back of the net again to force an overtime, and the Warriors tucked away their sixth and final point against a frustrated and exhausted Autumn Grove team.<br><br>

		Entering Wednesday’s Tri-State Showcase in Somerville, the Leafs’ exhaustion bled through as they took to the ice against GHS. Initially, AGHS’ performance looked promising, with the Leafs’ the first on the board with a goal from senior defenseman Marc Fontainebleau, assisted by seniors Maurice Ojo and Fitzpatrick. This only served to put a fire in the Shuckers’ bellies as they went on to put two on the board by the end of the first period as the Leafs’ first line of Fitzpatrick, Salinas, and Geuze continued to struggle connecting plays, leaving Coach Novak to pull at the end of the first.

The majority of the second and third periods were spent in defensive mode for AGHS, although their second and final point of the game was landed by Lane, with assists by senior Nick Antonov and Truch, during the awarded power play in the second. GHS displayed surprising grit and aggressiveness shortly after going back to full strength, with two additional points scored by the end of the second, pushing the Leafs’ to attempt to match the Shuckers’ energy by the start of the third. Possibly exhausted by Tuesday’s efforts or otherwise stymied, however, the Leafs grew sloppy on the ice, with the Shuckers outshooting them by the end of the game 33-20. After sophomores Charles Smith and Charles O’Toole were ejected from the ice for a double penalty, GHS was able to salt the Leafs’ wound with an empty netter, making the final score 2-6 for Gloucester.<br><br>

Despite the disheartening performances by the Leafs headed into the season opener on Sunday at Haverhill, AGHS has started preseason with uglier performances and ended up in line for State. It remains to be seen if this year’s crop of promising-yet-hotheaded varsity starters will be cut from the same cloth as some of those very teams, but only time &ndash; and Sunday’s performance against the Sandpipers &ndash; will truly tell.
